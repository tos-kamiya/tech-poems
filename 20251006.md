# How Should I Save My AI Chat History?

## For Now, I’m Going with `.aichat.md`

Recently, I’ve been asking AI tools to write **small utility scripts** for me —
things like one-file CLI helpers or quick configuration scripts.
They’re too small to justify creating a full repository,
but still useful enough that I want to keep them organized.

The AI generates the code, I test it, everything works fine...
and then, later on, I find myself wondering:

> Wait—why did we decide to do it that way again?

## I Want to Keep the Conversation Too

That’s when I realized I also wanted to **save the chat conversation** itself.
But then comes the question: *what should the file be called?*

`ollama-update.txt`
Hmm... is that a plain text file? A log? A note?
Nothing about that name says “AI chat history.”

I also want Markdown syntax highlighting —
code blocks, lists, formatting, the works.
But as far as I could tell, **there’s no standard file extension** for this purpose yet.

## No Standard? Then Make One.

I searched around.
Even tools that deeply integrate AI — like Zed or Cursor —
don’t define any clear convention for saving chat logs.

So, I decided to make my own rule.
I only had two requirements:

1. It should be obvious that this file is an AI chat log.
2. It should open as Markdown in any editor.

## Settling on `.aichat.md`

Let’s say I was working on a script called `ollama-update`.
I now save the chat session as:

```
ollama-update.aichat.md
```

* `.aichat` clearly shows that it’s an AI chat record.
* `.md` indicates it’s written in Markdown format.

In other words, it’s a **hybrid extension** —
a custom tag plus a standard format.
Every editor recognizes it as Markdown,
and when I see it listed with `ls`, I instantly know what it is.

Even if the script and the chat file end up separated,
the file name itself makes it easy to see the connection.

## How I Actually Use It

In my workflow, I also keep short **execution examples** inside the same `.aichat.md` file.
They’re often naturally part of the chat anyway,
since I’m explaining what the script should do to the AI.

This way, the **conversation → code → test** flow
is neatly captured within a single Markdown document.
When I look back later, it’s easy to recall what I was thinking.

```
ollama-update-proj/
  ├── ollama-update
  └── ollama-update.aichat.md
```

For small, one-off scripts, this setup feels just right.

---

## I’ll Stick with This for Now

Eventually, I’m sure some **best practices for saving AI chat histories** will emerge.
But for now, `.aichat.md` feels like the most reasonable and self-descriptive option.

It’s a small personal rule for those moments
when I ask AI to build something lightweight —
not quite a full project, but still worth remembering how it came to be.
