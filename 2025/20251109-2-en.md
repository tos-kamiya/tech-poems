## Redefining Scientific Decision-Making: Reconstructing Exploration and Verification in the Age of AI

### 1. What Is Scientific Decision-Making?

Science has not advanced merely through the accumulation of data and theories.
What has truly sustained it is the shared **system of decision-making** by which researchers in each era determined what counts as “true,” and which hypotheses deserve to be trusted.
This decision-making has been supported not only by individual beliefs or observations, but also by social mechanisms such as peer review, collaboration, and reproducibility experiments.

### 2. The Advent of Exploratory Science and the Role of AI

With the introduction of AI, science has entered an “exploratory” phase.
AI can generate millions of hypotheses simultaneously and evaluate their likelihoods against existing theories and observational data.
As a result, the focus of scientific inquiry has shifted from “formulating a single hypothesis” to “exploring and optimizing a population of hypotheses.”
Yet this shift has also created new challenges that existing peer-review and research ethics frameworks cannot easily handle—
namely, the proliferation of **plausible but superficial ‘truths’** generated by AI.

### 3. The Turn Toward “Hypothesis Transparency”

In this new era, science must demand not only the submission of results but also the sharing of the **decision-making history**—
how the search space was defined, which hypotheses were excluded, and why.
This represents a call for **transparency in the process of hypothesis generation**, beyond the reproducibility of data or code.
Submitting entire hypothesis sets, archiving exploration logs, and making selection criteria explicit—these steps elevate scientific accountability to a new level.

### 4. Reconstructing Science as a Collaborative and Verifiable Enterprise

Within this new framework, research outcomes will be evaluated not by *who discovered what*,
but by *who designed the hypothesis space, and how that space was collaboratively refined*.
Peer review will examine not only the validity of the final hypothesis but also the soundness of the overall exploration process.
Thus, scientific decision-making will be **reconstructed from individual insight to collective deliberation**.

### 5. Significance and Challenges

This redefinition transforms science from a mere site of knowledge production into a **socially auditable system for knowledge generation**.
At the same time, it raises a practical question: how can we store, evaluate, and compare vast sets of hypotheses?
Meeting this challenge will require an intellectual infrastructure for *recording* and *interpretation* comparable to AI’s computational power.

Viewed in a longer historical perspective, this trajectory follows naturally from the automation of DNA sequencing and laboratory processes in the biosciences.
Beyond the automation of tasks, it is a **project to make scientific decision-making itself transparent**, demanding new forms of ethics and institutional design in the AI era.

### 6. Conclusion

AI does not replace science.
Rather, it enables us to **redesign science as a collaborative and verifiable decision-making process**.
This transformation marks the next stage in the maturation of exploratory science.
It not only safeguards the credibility of research but also opens a path toward a new intellectual system that realizes the *democratization of knowledge*.
